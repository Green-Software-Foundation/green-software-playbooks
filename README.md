# Green Software Playbooks

This project is aimed at providing engineering teams at Information and Communications Technology (ICT) companies the means to determine and make progress towards ensuring their products and practices are built and managed as sustainably as possible. Guidance and recommendations will be categorized based on the type of work the team is engaged in.

This project is run through the [Community Working Group](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/community-wg) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

## Scope
The project aims to create detailed playbooks for teams at ICT companies regardless of the technology stack they are involved in. Any engineering team in any part of the organization should be able to find a playbook suitable for the work that they do and follow the steps in order to reduce emissions and improve the overall sustainability of their work.

This project aims to address:

* Helping teams be more self-directed in improving the sustainability of their products and workflow.
* Helping teams prioritize changes that are the most impactful with the available resources.
* Helping teams identify potential approaches regardless of which division or organization within a company they belong to.
