# Green Software Playbooks

This project is aimed at providing engineering teams at Information and Communications Technology (ICT) companies the means to determine and make progress towards ensuring their products and practices are built and managed as sustainably as possible. Guidance and recommendations will be categorized based on the type of work the team is engaged in.

This project is run through the [Community Working Group](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/community-wg) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

## Scope
The primary audience is teams of developers and engineers at ICT companies, regardless of size or organization. In particular, development leads and project managers should be able to use the guides to determine what practices and recommendations would make the most sense to follow and provide the most benefit for the effort. Making development teams aware of this resource will be important to its usefulness. This project would be appropriate for any conference aimed at improving development processes and, particularly, sustainable development conferences aimed at helping engineers make their products run cleaner.

This project aims to address:

* Helping teams be more self-directed in improving the sustainability of their products and workflow.
* Helping teams prioritize changes that are the most impactful with the available resources.
* Helping teams identify potential approaches regardless of which division or organization within a company they belong to.
