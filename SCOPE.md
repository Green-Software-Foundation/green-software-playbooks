# Problem Statement

Engineering teams working in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) companies do not have a paved path or set of processes to follow to improve the sustainability of their products, tools, or infrastructure.  Individual contributors or teams would need to seek out and collect relevant information and techniques to apply to their technology stack and then evaluate if the changes resulted in the desired improvement.  If there are multiple techniques, the teams would have to determine on their own an optimal order of application.

# Scope

The project aims to create detailed playbooks for teams at ICT companies regardless of the technology stack they are involved in.  Any engineering team in any part of the organization should be able to find a playbook suitable for the work that they do and follow the steps in order to reduce emissions and improve the overall sustainability of their work.

# Target Audience

This project is aimed at engineering teams at ICT companies and organizations, regardless of size.  In particular, development leads and project managers should be able to use the guides to determine what practices and recommendations would make the most sense to follow and provide the most benefit for the effort.

# Objectives

* Create a comprehensive list of engineering team types
* Determine appropriate techniques and processes to improve sustainability
* Collect them into a playbook that creates a 'paved path' for teams to follow

# Deliverables

* A set of playbooks with clearly detailed steps and processes for engineering and development teams to follow

# Definition of version 1.0

A basic set of playbooks for the major engineering team types.
